### About the Experiment 

T cells and B cells are key components of the immune system, which uses a variety of cell types to defend the body from infections. While B cells play an important part in humoral immunity by generating antibodies, T cells are largely involved in cell-mediated immunity. Isolating and visualising these cells is critical for understanding their roles, relationships, and immunological responses.
